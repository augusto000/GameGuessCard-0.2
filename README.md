# GameGuessCard-0.2
card guessing game abstraction is represented as one of the requirements of object-oriented programming. The game is started from the board and 13 cards are shuffled from 1 to 13 in which the player must guess if the next card is higher or lower than the current one. You win 100 and lose 75 points by guessing correctly or incorrectly, each time you can decide to withdraw and save the points or when reaching 0 (zero points) the game ends.
